What is this folder? - purpose & content
===============
	___________________________ Please note __________________________________  
	I am new to virtual env (as you may see), thus;   
	the solution is messy and probably not very useful.  
	Honestly, the crude solution might have caused more problems than it fixed.  

Purpose:
---------------
Will install config settings as enviourment variables.
	"install_virtual_env.bat" is the manager of this folder 

Content:
---------------
*NOTE: I don't think 1-3 is nessasary since setEnv.bat has it all.* 
1. /env/ : the enviourment containing the nessasary paths for config 
2. activate_env.bat : finds and calls the actual activate.bat
3. env_builder.bat : build the virtual env 
4. install_virtual_env.bat : The manager for all the bats
5. setEnv.bat : sets paths (security risk)
